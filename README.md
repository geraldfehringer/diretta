## Protocol overview

> Diretta is a data transmission protocol based on IPV6 and the connection between a "host" (server integrating Windows drivers - ASIO - or Linux - ALSA -) and a "target" (streamer connected to the DAC). The principle is to send a constant flow of data in order to avoid data peaks. Initially designed to operate in USB, Diretta offers "targets" in i2S LVDS and by installing an OS type Gentooplayer which integrates the ALSA Diretta drivers, it is possible to output on the different outputs offered by the streamer-target (AES, SPDIF, USB, i2s, ...).
